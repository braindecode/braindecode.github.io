Sleep staging on the Sleep Physionet dataset
============================================

This tutorial shows how to train and test a sleep staging neural network with
Braindecode. We follow the approach of [1]_ on the openly accessible Sleep
Physionet dataset [1]_ [2]_.

Loading and preprocessing the dataset

Loading
~~~~~~~


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-57

First, we load the data using the
:class:`braindecode.datasets.sleep_physionet.SleepPhysionet` class. We load
two recordings from two different individuals: we will use the first one to
train our network and the second one to evaluate performance (as in the `MNE`_
sleep staging example).

.. _MNE: https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/sample-datasets/plot_sleep.html

.. note::
   To load your own datasets either via MNE or from
   preprocessed X/y numpy arrays, see the `MNE Dataset
   Tutorial <./plot_mne_dataset_example.html>`__ and the `Numpy Dataset
   Tutorial <./plot_custom_dataset_example.html>`__.

We can now train our network. :class:`braindecode.EEGClassifier` is a
braindecode object that is responsible for managing the training of neural
networks. It inherits from :class:`skorch.NeuralNetClassifier`, so the
training logic is the same as in
`Skorch <https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 214-220

**Note**: We use different hyperparameters from [1]_, as
these hyperparameters were optimized on a different dataset (MASS SS3) and
with a different number of recordings. Generally speaking, it is
recommended to perform hyperparameter optimization if reusing this code on
a different dataset or with more recordings.

Our model was able to perform reasonably well given the low amount of data
available, reaching a balanced accuracy of around 55% in a 5-class
classification task (chance-level = 20%) on held-out data.

To further improve performance, more recordings can be included in the
training set, and various modifications can be made to the model (e.g.,
aggregating the representation of multiple consecutive windows [1]_).
